# Feature_Engineering
Let's start up the Feature Engineering concept in deep

**What is it?**
Feature engineering is the process of pre-processing data so that your model/learning
algorithm may spend as little time as possible sifting through the noise. Any information
that is unrelated to learning or forecasting concerning your final aim is known as noise.

**What is Timesstamp?**
Timestamp values are accepted in the format 'yyyy‑MM‑dd HH:mm:ss. SSSSSS' , and can consist
of just the date, or just the time, with or without the fractional second portion. 
For example, you can specify TIMESTAMP values such as '1966‑07‑30' , '08:30:00' , or '1985‑09‑25 17:45:30.005' .
It is of an additional Feature

**What is jackknife and bootstrap?**
Bootstrap and jackknife are statistical tools used to investigate bias and standard errors of estimators.
Both are resampling/cross-validation techniques, meaning they are used to generate new samples from the original data
of the representative population.
Bootstrap constructs the sampling distribution of an estimator by repeatedly drawing samples from the original sample to find 
standard error and confidence interval. Jackknife draws repeated samples while leaving out one observation at a time from the set,
without replacing it.
